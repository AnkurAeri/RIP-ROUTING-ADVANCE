# RIP-ROUTING-ADVANCE

I created a multi-router network with numerous different subnets linked by link networks. Here's a breakdown of what I did:Here's a breakdown of what I did: 
 
 Network Design: 
 
 TN with precisely defined Subnets with respect to their defined IP address range. 
 Created virtual connections for inter-subnet communication. 
 
 Router Configuration: 
 Provided router interfaces with IP addresses that corresponds to the network diagram above. 
 For dynamic routing practice RIP routing protocol was initiated throughout all the routers. 
 Setup MOTD for each router to display the routers name where the routers owner name is also included is my full name. 
 Std clock rando for consistent network operation is 56000. 
 
 PC Configuration: 
 Customize subnet masks and IP address for all PCs in every subnet and also the default gateway to be used. 
 Assigned the DNS server address (Server PC) for connectivity to the internet. 
 Testing and Verification: 
 
 Carried out checks on the network connection between the equipments using ping thr commands. 
 Checked connectivity to the World Wide Web by trying to open the website ‘www. georgian. com’. 
 Disrupting the routing tables and testing packet drops on a network to solve issues that may occur in it. 
 Overall, this project demonstrates my ability to:
 
 Build a configuring and designing multiple routers network. 
 Use RIP routing protocol for communication. 
 Program network devices, routers, PCs etc with correct settings. 
 Troubleshoot network connectivity issues. 
 Ensure that the most obvious and rudimentary security fail-safes are in place (at the very least, MOTD banners).
